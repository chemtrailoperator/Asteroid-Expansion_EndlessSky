	description "This is a heavily modified and upgraded variant of the trusty Mining Laser. It includes improved optics that improve accuracy and range, higher strength components, and light frequencies adapted to decomposing rock instead of vaporizing it."
	description "The new design makes it even less effective against shields than before, and much more epxensive to build."
